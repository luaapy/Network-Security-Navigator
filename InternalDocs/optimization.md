# NSN Optimization Strategies

## Bytecode Optimization
The NSN compiler performs peephole optimizations on the generated bytecode to remove redundant instructions.

## String Interning
Commonly used strings (like module names and keywords) are interned to speed up dictionary lookups.

## Arena Allocation
Small, frequently allocated objects use an arena allocator to reduce the overhead of standard `malloc` calls.

## Networking Fast-path
Critical network operations are implemented in C and bypassed the interpreter logic whenever possible for maximum throughput.
