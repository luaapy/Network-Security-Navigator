# NSN macOS Build Scripts

This directory contains the tools needed to build and package NSN for macOS.

## Contents
- `build-installer.py` – Python script that compiles the interpreter, creates a signed `.app` bundle, and packages it into a DMG installer.
- `README.txt` – Detailed usage instructions for the installer script.
- `Icons/` – Application icon (`NSN.icns`) generated from the SVG logo.

## Quick Start
```bash
cd path/to/nsn/Mac/BuildScript
python3 build-installer.py
```
The script will produce `build/NSN.dmg` ready for distribution.

## Prerequisites
- macOS 10.12+ with Xcode command‑line tools (`xcode-select --install`).
- CMake (install via Homebrew: `brew install cmake`).
- Python 3 (standard library only).
- Optional: Apple Developer account for code‑signing and notarization.
