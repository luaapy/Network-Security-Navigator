NSN Miscellaneous Files
=======================

This directory contains various files used by the NSN build system, 
packaging tools, and for specialized development tasks.

Contents
--------

* `ACKS`: Acknowledgments list for project contributors.
* `HISTORY`: Significant milestones in the project's development.
* `NEWS.d/`: Directory for individual news entries (RST format).
* `python-config.in`: Template for the `nsn-config` script, used to
  retrieve build flags for embedding the interpreter.
* `stable_abi.toml`: Definition of the NSN stable ABI for extensions.
* `valgrind-nsn.supp`: Valgrind suppression file for filtering out
  known false positives in the interpreter and core libraries.
* `python-config.in`: Source for the configuration script.

Usage
-----

Most files in this directory are used automatically by the build system
or the CI/CD pipeline. Developers adding new C API functions should update
`stable_abi.toml` if the new functions are intended to be part of the stable
binary interface.
