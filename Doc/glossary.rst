NSN (Network Security Navigator)
    A high‑performance, cross‑platform programming language for network security research and automation.

REPL
    Read‑Eval‑Print Loop – an interactive interpreter session where users can type NSN code and see immediate results.

Bytecode
    A low‑level, platform‑independent representation of NSN source code generated by the compiler and executed by the virtual machine.

VM (Virtual Machine)
    The runtime component that interprets NSN bytecode, manages execution frames, and handles memory management.

Standard Library
    A collection of built‑in modules written in NSN (e.g., ``network``, ``security``, ``datetime``) that provide high‑level functionality.

Module
    A reusable unit of code, similar to a Python module, that can be imported with ``import <module>``.

Object
    The fundamental data structure in NSN; everything is an object with a type and reference count.

Garbage Collection
    Automatic memory management that frees objects when their reference count drops to zero.
